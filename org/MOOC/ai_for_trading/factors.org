* Overview
  A factor is a list of numerical values, one for each stock, *potentially predictive* of an aspect
  of the performance of these stocks in the future.

  Other words, factors are signals that help suggest where to place bets in a portfolio of stocks
  and further suggest what relative magnitudes of those bets should be.


  - Alpha Factors :: drivers of mean returns
  - Risk Factors :: drivers of volatility

** Categories
   - Momentum
   - Fundamental information
   - Signals from social media

** Example of a Factor
   - Hypothesis: one-year return indicates momentum for next few days.
   - Factor: one-year return of each stock in stock universe.

   - Target
     - Predict future price value? Difficult.
     - Compare stocks using factor values? More feasible.

   - Follow the hypothesis indication: Higher factor value -> hypothesize higher expected future return -> Higher weight

* Standardizing Factors
  1. Sum of weights equals zero
     - ~de-mean~ $\forall{i}\ x_i = raw_i - raw_\mu$
  1. Sum of absolute values equals one (i.e. leverage ratio = 1)
     - ~re-scaled~: $\lambda=\sum_{i=1}^N|x_i|$ and $\forall{i}\ x_i = \frac{x_i}{\lambda}$

** Example

** Leverage Ratio
   Leverage ratio in portfolio is =sum of positions/notional=.
   $$ratio=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N|p_i|}{Notional}$$
   - =sum of weights= should be 2 if the leverage ratio you choose is 2.

* Factor Model
  A factor model is a statistical model used to describe *variability* among observed correlated variables in terms
  of potentially smaller number of unobserved variables called factors. This method is used in several disciplines
  including biology, psychology, and business, as well as finance.

  In finance, we interested in modeling *the returns of several assets*.

  - Observed Variables: returns.
  - Unobserved(Latent) Variables: factors returns.

** Linear Factor Model
   Returns(observed variables) are modeled as linear combinations of *the factors returns* plus *error terms*.
  $$r_i=b_{i1}f_1+b_{i2}f_2+...+b_{ik}f_k+s_i$$
  $$\boldsymbol{R}=\boldsymbol{BF+S}$$
  - $r_i$: the return on asset $i$
  - $f_1$: the value of factor return 1
  - $b_{i1}$(stock exposures to factors): the change in the return on asset $i$ per unit change in factor return 1
  - $k$: the number of factors
  - $s_i$(/error term/ or /unexplained portion/): the portion of the return on asset $i$ not related to the $k$ factors

** Terminology
   - Factor returns (the $f_k$) may be:
     - macro-economic variables
     - returns on *pre-specified portfolios*
     - returns on zero-investment strategies (long and short positions of equal value) giving maximum exposure to fundamental or macro-economic factors
     - returns on benchmark portfolios representing asset classes
     - ...
   - $b_{ij}$ coefficients may be called:
     - factor exposures
     - factor sensitivities
     - factor loadings
     - factor betas
     - asset exposures
     - style
     - ...
   - $s_i$ term may be called:
     - idiosyncratic return
     - security-specific return
     - non-factor return
     - residual return
     - selection return
     - ...

** Factor Model Assumptions
   - $Corr(s_i, f_k)=0$ for every $i$ and $k$
   - $Corr(s_i, s_j)=0$ for every $i$ not equal to $j$
   - Residual $s_i$ is specific or "idiosyncratic" to asset $i$

** Covariance Matrix of the Asset Returns
   $\boldsymbol{R}=\begin{bmatrix}
   r_1 \\
   \vdots \\
   r_n
   \end{bmatrix}$

   \boldsymbol{B}=\begin{bmatrix}
   b_{1,1} & \cdots & b_{1,k} \\
   \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
   b_{n,1} & \cdots & b_{n,k}
   \end{bmatrix}$

   $\boldsymbol{F}=\begin{bmatrix}
   f_1 \\
   \vdots \\
   f_k
   \end{bmatrix}$

   $\boldsymbol{S}=\begin{bmatrix}
   s_1 \\
   \vdots \\
   s_n
   \end{bmatrix}$
   - n: number of companies
   - k: number of factors

   Based on *assumptions*, calculate the covariance matrix of the asset returns -- Matrix$[Cov(r_i, r_j)]$.
   $$Cov(X,Y)=E[(X-\bar{X})(Y-\bar{Y}))]=E[XY]$$
   $$Cov(\boldsymbol{RR^T})=E[\boldsymbol{RR^T}]=E[(\boldsymbol{BF+S})(\boldsymbol{BF+S})^T]=\boldsymbol{BFB}^T+\boldsymbol{S}$$

* Factors
  Two types of factors
  - Alpha Factor :: Predictive of mean, drivers of mean returns.
  - Risk Factor :: Predictive of variance, drivers of volatility.

  Portfolio should be minimally exposed to risk factors. We can try to place *constraints* on $\boldsymbol{B^T F}$
  that only apply to factors that we think are *drivers of volatility*. However, we don't constrain the factors
  that are *drivers of mean returns*. So we drop alpha factors from *B* matrix.

  Hence, in practice,
  - *B* is the *risk factor loading* matrix only.
  - *F* include risk factors only.
  - *S* includes all other variance. *S* says nothing explicit about alpha.

  Alpha Factors add to *objective function* in optimization.

* Inspirations
** Momentum Indicators
   - Moving averages
   - Large price movements with volume
   - Stocks making new highs
