* Overview
  A factor is a list of numerical values, one for each stock, *potentially predictive* of an aspect
  of the performance of these stocks in the future.

  Other words, factors are signals that help suggest where to place bets in a portfolio of stocks
  and further suggest what relative magnitudes of those bets should be.


  - Alpha Factors :: drivers of mean returns
  - Risk Factors :: drivers of volatility

** Categories
   - Momentum
   - Fundamental information
   - Signals from social media

** Example of a Factor
   - Hypothesis: one-year return indicates momentum for next few days.
   - Factor: one-year return of each stock in stock universe.

   - Target
     - Predict future price value? Difficult.
     - Compare stocks using factor values? More feasible.

   - Follow the hypothesis indication: Higher factor value -> hypothesize higher expected future return -> Higher weight

* Standardizing Factors
  1. Sum of weights equals zero
     - ~de-mean~ $\forall{i}\ x_i = raw_i - raw_\mu$
  1. Sum of absolute values equals one (i.e. leverage ratio = 1)
     - ~re-scaled~: $\lambda=\sum_{i=1}^N|x_i|$ and $\forall{i}\ x_i = \frac{x_i}{\lambda}$

** Leverage Ratio
   Leverage ratio in portfolio is =sum of positions/notional=.
   $$ratio=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N|p_i|}{Notional}$$
   - =sum of weights= should be 2 if the leverage ratio you choose is 2.

* Linear Factor Model
  $$r_i=b_{i1}f_1+b_{i2}f_2+...+b_{iK}f_K+s_i$$
  - $r_i$: the return on asset $i$
  - $f_1$: the value of factor return 1
  - $b_{i1}$(stock exposures to factors): the change in the return on asset $i$ per unit change in factor return 1
  - $K$: the number of factors
  - $s_i$(/error term/ or /unexplained portion/): the portion of the return on asset i not related to the $K$ factors

** Terminology
   - Factor returns (the $f_k s$) may be:
     - macro-economic variables
     - returns on *pre-specified portfolios*
     - returns on zero-investment strategies (long and short positions of equal value) giving maximum exposure to fundamental or macro-economic factors
     - returns on benchmark portfolios representing asset classes
     - ...
   - $b_{ij}$ coefficients may be called:
     - factor exposures
     - factor sensitivities
     - factor loadings
     - factor betas
     - asset exposures
     - style
     - ...
   - $s_i$ term may be called:
     - idiosyncratic return
     - security-specific return
     - non-factor return
     - residual return
     - selection return
     - ...
