* Overview
  A factor is a list of numerical values, one for each stock, *potentially predictive* of an aspect
  of the performance of these stocks in the future.

  Other words, factors are signals that help suggest where to place bets in a portfolio of stocks
  and further suggest what relative magnitudes of those bets should be.
