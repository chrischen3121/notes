* Overview
  A factor is a list of numerical values, one for each stock, *potentially predictive* of an aspect
  of the performance of these stocks in the future.

  Other words, factors are signals that help suggest where to place bets in a portfolio of stocks
  and further suggest what relative magnitudes of those bets should be.


  - Alpha Factors :: drivers of mean returns
  - Risk Factors :: drivers of volatility

** Categories
   - Momentum
   - Fundamental information
   - Signals from social media

** Example of a Factor
   - Hypothesis: one-year return indicates momentum for next few days.
   - Factor: one-year return of each stock in stock universe.

   - Target
     - Predict future price value? Difficult.
     - Compare stocks using factor values? More feasible.

   - Follow the hypothesis indication: Higher factor value -> hypothesize higher expected future return -> Higher weight

* Standardizing Factors
  1. Sum of weights equals zero
     - ~de-mean~ $\forall{i}\ x_i = raw_i - raw_\mu$
  1. Sum of absolute values equals one (i.e. leverage ratio = 1)
     - ~re-scaled~: $\lambda=\sum_{i=1}^N|x_i|$ and $\forall{i}\ x_i = \frac{x_i}{\lambda}$

** Leverage Ratio
   Leverage ratio in portfolio is =sum of positions/notional=.
   $$ratio=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N|p_i|}{Notional}$$
   - =sum of weights= should be 2 if the leverage ratio you choose is 2.

   - Large price movements with volume
   - Stocks making new highs
