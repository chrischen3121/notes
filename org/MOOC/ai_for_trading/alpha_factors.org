** Processing Techniques
   Techniques to turn the alpha vectors into signals.
   - Sector neutralization
   - Ranking
   - Z-scoring
   - Smoothing
   - Conditioning

   Use risk models to *neutralize* exposure to risk factors, so that
   remaining portfolio returns and volatility are due to alpha factors.

** Alpha Model
   An algorithm that transforms data into numbers associated with each asset.
