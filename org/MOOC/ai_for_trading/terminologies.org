* Finance Concept
- Stock :: An asset that represents ownership in a company. A claim on part of a corportation's assets and earnings. There are two main types, common and preferred.
- Share :: A single share represents partial ownership of a company relative to the total number of shares in existence.
- Common Stock :: One main type of stock; entitles the owner to receive dividends and to vote at shareholder meetings.
- Preferred Stock :: The other main type of stock; generally does not entail voting rights, but entitles the owner to a higher claim on the assets and earnings of a company.
- Dividend :: A partial distribution of a company's profits to shareholders.
- Security :: A tradable financial asset.
- Debt Security :: Money that is owed and must be repaid, like government or corporate bonds, or certificates of deposit. Also called fixed-income securities.
- Derivative Security :: A financial instrument whereby its value is derived from other assets.
- Equity :: The value of an owned asset minus the amount of all debts on that asset.
- Equity Security :: A security that represents fractional ownership in an entity, such as stock.
- Option Contract :: A contract which gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specified price on or by a specified date
- Futures Contract :: A contract that obligates the buyer to buy or the seller to sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future
- Leverage :: Leverage is the act of borrowing in order to invest. Borrowing cash in order to go long on more positions may magnify gains but also losses.
- Active/Passive Funds :: Active funds(aka Alpha funds) seek to outperform its benchmark, Passive funds(aka Index/Beta Funds) seek to track its benchmark.
- Treasury Securities :: In the U.S., Treasury bills mature in 1 year or less, Treasury notes mature in 2 to 10 years, and Treasury bonds mature in 20 to 30 years.
- Efficient Market Hypothesis :: All available information is reflected in the current price of an asset.

* Accounting
- Capital Gains :: Profits that result from the sale of an asset at a price higher than the purchase price.
- Total Market Capitalization :: The dollar value of a company's outstanding shares.
- Notional(or Trade Book Value) :: The gross dollar amount associated with a portfolio. $Dollars_i=w_i\times Notional$
- Book Value :: The company's accounting value which is assets minus liabilities.
- Free Float :: The free float shares is the total shares minus shares that are not readily available in the market.
- AUM :: Assets Under Management
- NAV :: Net Asset Value
  $$NAV=\frac{AUM-Expenses}{\text{number of shares}}$$
  - Expenses are the costs of running the fund. Often defined as a ratio called *Gross Expense Ratio*
  - *Net Expense Ratio* is a discount of *Gross Expense Ratio* which offers to early customers. (not permanent)
- Mark to Market :: Accounting Concept that assess the value of a health asset at its market price. Unrealized profit/loss.

* Strategy
- Overnight Return :: Close price of previous evening to open price of next morning. "Close to open returns"
- Cross-sectional Analysis :: Cross-sectional analysis looks at data collected at a single point in time, rather than over a period of time. OPP Time-series Analysis
- Backtesting :: The process of rigorously simulating the entire flow in an automated fashion using historical data.
- Market-neutral :: Gains and losses are less sensitive to movements in the overall market.
- Roll Over Contract :: Extend your position into the future, like renewing your gym membership.
- Alpha :: An expression that outputs a vector of values which are proportional to the size of the position you will take on each asset.
  - The procedure that produces the ranks. The ranks themselves make up the *Alpha Vector*.
- Contrarian Strategies :: seek to identify sudden price movements and trade against such movements.(minute level data, risky)
- Lookahead Bias :: Incorporating the information from the future.(this misuse often make your results look better)
- Signal to Noise Ratio :: The signal is the meaningful part of input data. The noise is the random part of input data. The ratio is low for finance, the output models tend to *overfit* the data.
- Take-profit Level :: 止盈线 Defined as a target price or a percent change from an entry price.
- Stop-loss level :: 止损线
- Smart Beta (Portfolios) :: active + passive fund management.
- Curse of Dimensionality :: Out of core issue. In one dimension 9000 stocks -> 81million-value covariance matrix.
  - Alternative: Risk Factor Model
- "Historical Measure" of risk :: The process of calculating the covariance matrix of assets.
- Alpha Vector :: A list of numbers for a single time period. Each number in the alpha vector is proportional to the amount of money we want to allocate towards each stock.
- Pearson Correlation :: $\rho(X,Y)=\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{Std(X)\times Std(Y)}$, is also the sqrt of the R-squared in a linear regression.
- Spearman Rank Correlation :: The correlation of ranked values
- Accelerated Gains :: Convex shape, OPP Decelerated Gains(Concave shape)

* Trading
- Inflection Point :: 拐点
- Short Interest :: Tracks the quantity of a stock shares, which are held short.
- Volume :: Number of shares traded.
- Turnover :: Volume Traded $\times$ Price Per Share
- Basis Points :: Ask $100.05 Bid $100 Then the bid-ask spread is five basis points.

* Data Processing
- Data-snooping(P-hacking) :: The misuse of data analysis to find patterns in data by performing many statistical tests on the data and only reporting those that come back with significant results.
- Quartiles :: Quartiles are the three dividing lines that divide the data into four groups.
