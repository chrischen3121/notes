* Overview
  1. Finding Pairs
  1. Calculating Hedge Ratio
  1. Calculating Spread
  1. Is Spread Stationary?
  1. If Yes, candidate for *Mean Reversion Trading*.
  1. Choosing Thresholds for Spread
  1. If Spread widens/narrows, short/long the spread.
  1. Backtesting

* Finding Pairs
  Finding the economic links
  - Government Policies
  - Customers and suppliers with in the same supply chain
  - Timezone Lag

  Insights
  - Looking for a time lag

  Checking
  - check if spread is stationary

* Mean Reversion
  A mean reverting time series is one that tends to move back and forth around some constant value.
** Drift and Volatility
   To describe a mean reverting process
   - Drift Term :: Long Term Average
   - Volatility Term :: Randomness

   Formula:
   $$dp_t=p_t\mu dt + p_t\sigma\epsilon\sqrt{dt}$$

   - $dp_t$ represents the change in price over the time t
   - drift term $p_t\mu dt$
     - $p_t$: current price
     - $\mu$: a constant average mu
     - $dt$: change in time
   - volatility term $p_t\sigma\epsilon\sqrt{dt}$
     - $p_t$: current price
     - $\sigma$: a standard deviation sigma
     - $\epsilon$: a random noise factor

* Hedge Ratio
  Two ways to calculate the hedge ratio
  1. The Price Ratio $\frac{B}{A}$: the price of stock B divided by the price of stock A
  2. Run a Linear Regression $B=\beta A + \alpha$
     - Stock A is the independent variable.
     - Stock B is the dependent variable.
     - the coefficient $\beta$ is the hedge ratio.

  The difference is that the regression accounts for a series of previous prices.

* Spread
  - B and A are prices of two assets.
  $$Spread = B_{actual} - B_{estimate}$$
  $$B_{estimate}=\beta A_{actual} + \alpha$$
  - $\beta$ is the hedge ratio

* Cointegration
  Two stocks $y_t\sim I(1)$, $x_t\sim I(1)$
  Try linear regression:
  $$y_t\approx\beta x_t + \alpha$$
  $$Spread = y_t - \beta x_t$$
  $$Spread(with\_intercept) = y_t - (\alpha + \beta x_t)$$
  - If spread is stationary, then Spread is I(0) and x, y are cointegrated.
  - Hedge Ratio $\beta$ is coefficient of cointegrated.

** Cointegration $\ne$ Correlation
   - Cointegration means that, over a range of days, the *relative increase* in A is matched by a *relative increase* in B.
   - A strong positive correlation means when stock A moves up stock B moves up *at the same time* and vice versa. (not measure the *relative increase*)

** Test for Checking Cointegration
*** Two-Step Engle-Granger Test
   1. Get hedge ratio from a linear regression
      - run a regression on one series against the other $y_t=\beta x_t$
   1. Create a new spread series $z_t=y_t-\beta x_t$
   1. Check if spread $z_t$ is stationary
      - if spread is stationary, the two series are cointegrated

*** Check If Spread is Stationary
    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
    - $pvalue\le 0.05$: spread is stationary

    #+begin_src python
      # Augmented Dickey Fuller Test
      from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

      # adfuller(x, maxlag=None, regression='c', autolag='AIC', store=False, regresults=False)[source]
      adf_result = adfuller(spread_series)

      adf = adf_result[0]
      pvalue = adf_result[1]
    #+end_src

** How to Find Cointegration Pairs
   - Compare every pair of stocks in the universe: $n\times n$ comparisons. (May use GPU)
   - Group stocks by sector, industry...
   - Use *Clustering*, a class of unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
     - Inputs are time series.

* Signals
  - *Principle: Buy Low Sell High*: Buy when it's on sale, and sell when it's overpriced.
  [[../../resources/MOOC/Trading/trade_pairs.png]]
  - Short the Spread :: Short the asset that has increased, long the asset that has decreased. (relatively).
  - Long the Spread :: Short the asset that has increased, long the asset that has decreased.

** Defining Thresholds
   One way is to use the *Z-score* of the spread.

* Variations
** Group Pairs Trading
   If we grouped the stocks within the same industry into a virtual portfolio and calculated the return of that industry,
   this portfolio return would represent the general expected movement of all stocks within the industry. Then, for each
   individual stock series, we can calculate the spread between its return and the portfolio return. So when the spread
   between the single stock and the industry changes significantly, we can use that as a signal to buy or sell.

*** *Johansen Test*
    The *Johansen test* gives us coefficients that we can multiply to each of the stock series, so that a linear
    combination produces a number.
    $$w_1\times stock_1 + w_2\times stock_2 + w_3\times stock_3=spread$$

    We get the historical average of the spread. Then we check if the spread deviates significantly from that average.
    We check whether each of the three individual series moved up or down significantly to result in the change in spread.
    We short the series that are relatively high, and long the series that are relatively low. To determine how much to
    long or short, we again use the weights that are given by the Johansen test $(w_1, w_2, w_3)$

    - Note that for the purpose of cointegration trading we use the original price series, and do not convert them to log returns.

*** Example
    Let's say the spread has gotten larger. $w_1=0.5$, $w_2=0.3$, $w_3=-0.1$
    - proportions: 5 shares for $stock_1$, 3 shares for $stock_2$, 1 share for $stock_3$
    - If stock_1 stock is higher than usual (*relative to the others*), we short 5 shares of $stock_1$
      because we expect it should revert by decreasing relative to the others.
