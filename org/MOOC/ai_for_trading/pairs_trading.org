* Finding Pairs
  Finding the economic links

  - Timezone Lag

  Insights
  - Looking for a time lag

  Checking
  - check if spread is stationary

* Mean Reversion
  A mean reverting time series is one that tends to move back and forth around some constant value.
** Drift and Volatility
   To describe a mean reverting process
   - Drift Term :: Long Term Average
   - Volatility Term :: Randomness

   Formula:
   $$dp_t=p_t\mu dt + p_t\sigma\epsilon\sqrt{dt}$$

   - $dp_t$ represents the change in price over the time t
   - drift term $p_t\mu dt$
     - $p_t$: current price
     - $\mu$: a constant average mu
     - $dt$: change in time
   - volatility term $p_t\sigma\epsilon\sqrt{dt}$
     - $p_t$: current price
     - $\sigma$: a standard deviation sigma
     - $\epsilon$: a random noise factor

* Hedge Ratio
  Two ways to calculate the hedge ratio
  1. The Price Ratio $\frac{B}{A}$: the price of stock B divided by the price of stock A
  2. Run a Linear Regression $B=\beta A + \alpha$
     - Stock A is the independent variable.
     - Stock B is the dependent variable.
     - the coefficient $\beta$ is the hedge ratio.

  The difference is that the regression accounts for a series of previous prices.

* Spread
  $$Spread = B_{actual} - B_{estimate}$$
  $$B_{estimate}=\beta A + \alpha$$
  - $\beta$ is the hedge ratio

* Cointegration
  Two stocks $y_t\sim I(1)$, $x_t\sim I(1)$
  Try linear regression:
  $$y_t\approx\beta x_t + \alpha$$
  $$Spread = y_t - (\alpha + \beta x_t)$$
  - If spread is stationary, then Spread is I(0) and x, y are cointegrated.
  - Hedge Ratio $\beta$ is coefficient of cointegrated.

** Cointegration $\ne$ Correlation
   - Cointegration means that, over a range of days, the *relative increase* in A is matched by a *relative increase* in B.
   - A strong positive correlation means when stock A moves up stock B moves up *at the same time* and vice versa. (not measure the *relative increase*)

** Test for Checking Cointegration
   Two-Step Engle-Granger Test
   1. Get hedge ratio from a linear regression
   1. Calculate spread and check if spread is stationary
      - if spread is stationary, the two series are cointegrated

*** Check If Spread is Stationary
    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
    - $pvalue\le 0.05$: spread is stationary
