* Quant Workflow
  1. An initial hypothesis: an idea for a way to profit from trading.
     - How? The more you know about the markets, the more likely you are able to come up with a potentially profitable idea.

  1. Preliminary research and testing: in a fairly basic way, quickly test, determine:
     - *Signal* or *Alpha*
     - What assets to buy/sell at what time
  1. Detailed research and testing, and *backtesting*, to determine:
     - How to spend money
     - How to make trades
     - What conditions to exit positions
     - Risk constraints

* Why Invest in Complex Black-box Models?
  - risk the black box nature of the model in order to get access to *new* or *different* forecasts
    - pure AI-based strategies with exceptional performance
    - high Sharpe ratio high frequency algorithms
