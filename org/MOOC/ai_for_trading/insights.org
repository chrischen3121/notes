  1. An initial hypothesis: an idea for a way to profit from trading.
     - How? The more you know about the markets, the more likely you are able to come up with a potentially profitable idea.

  1. Preliminary research and testing: in a fairly basic way, quickly test, determine:
     - *Signal* or *Alpha*
     - What assets to buy/sell at what time
  1. Detailed research and testing, and *backtesting*, to determine:
     - How to spend money
     - How to make trades
     - What conditions to exit positions
     - Risk constraints

* Why Invest in Complex Black-box Models?
  - risk the black box nature of the model in order to get access to *new* or *different* forecasts
    - pure AI-based strategies with exceptional performance
    - high Sharpe ratio high frequency algorithms

* Strategy Inspiration
** Overnight Return
   - Firm-level Investor Sentiment
   - Either momentum or mean reversion
     - Momentum: Short-run persistence
     - Mean reversion: In a long time window
   - Harder to value firms
     - Investors may rely more on sentiment when the value of company are more difficult to measure.

*** Example
    1. Calculate overnight returns
    1. Aggregate weekly overnight returns (avg * five days)
    1. Momentum: Overweight stocks with higher weekly overnight returns
