* Raw Return & Log Return
  $$RawReturn(r) = \frac{p_t - p_{t-1}}{p_{t-1}}$$
  $$LogReturn(R) = ln(p_t/p_{t-1}) = ln(p_t) - ln(p_{t-1})$$
  $$LogReturn=ln(RawReturn+1)$$
  $$RawReturn=e^{LogReturn}-1$$

* Continuous Compounding
  - Compounding Formula
  $$p_t=p_{t-1}(1+\frac{r}{n})^n$$
  - Now make *n* bigger and bigger
  $$\lim_{n \to \infty}(1+\frac{r}{n})^n=e^r$$
  - Compounding infinitely often is called *continuous compounding*
  $$100\times e^{0.04}=104.08$$
  - Reverse the previous calculation
  $$104.08/100=e^r$$
  $$r=ln(104.08/100)=0.04$$
  - r is the *continuously compounded return*. It is just the *log return*

** Additivity
   Annual rate of *continuous compounding* is simply the sum of the monthly rates.
   - invest $100 for two years with a monthly  continuously compounded interest rate was 2%
   $$100\times{e^{0.02}}\times{e^{0.02}}... = 100\times{e^{(0.02+0.02+...)}}=100\times{e^{0.24}}=127.12$$
   - Time Additivity of Log Returns. *log return for Jan and Feb = log return for Jan + log return for Feb*
   $$ln(\frac{p_{Mar 1}}{p_{Jan 1}}) = ln(\frac{p_{Mar 1}}{p_{Feb 1}}) + ln(\frac{p_{Feb 1}}{p_{Jan 1}})$$

** Annualized Rate of Return
   If we just had a single monthly rate, but we assumed that the rates for all the months of the year were the same,
   we could /extrapolate/ the monthly rate to an annual rate by multiplying by 12. This is called *annualizing the
   rate of continuous compounding*.
   $$LogReturn(Y)=\sum_{M=1}^{12} LogReturn(M)=MeanOfLogReturn(M)\times 12$$
   $$RawReturn(Y)=e^{LogReturn(Y)}-1$$

** Compounding Example Table
   - rate of interest of 4%
   | Compounding Frequency | Value of $100 after 1 year |
   |-----------------------+----------------------------|
   | Annually(n=1)         | $104.00                    |
   | Quarterly(n=4)        | $104.06                    |
   | Weekly(n=52)          | $104.08                    |
   | Daily(n=252)          | $104.08                    |

* Distribution of Returns
  The conversation about the best model for the distribution of returns has been going on for at least the past century.
  The best model will depend on exactly what your analysis seeks to achieve.

* Why Log Returns?
  1. Log returns can be interpreted as *continuously compounded returns*.
  1. Log returns are time-additive. The multi-period log return is simply the sum of single period log returns.
  1. The use of log returns prevents security prices from becoming negative in models of security returns.
  1. log returns of a security can be reasonably modeled as distributed according to a normal distribution. ?
  1. When returns and log returns are small, their values are approximately equal.
  1. Logarithms can help make an algorithm more *numerically stable*.

** Compare with Simple Returns
   Arithmetic or the simple return allows for an easier *cross-sectional* returns understanding
   while log returns allow for easier returns understanding *across time* which are *volatile*.
