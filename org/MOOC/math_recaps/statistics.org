    - Discrete: trees in yard, pages in a book
  - Categorical
    - Ordinal: letter grade, survey rating
    - Nominal: gender, breakfast items

* Summary Statistics
** Measures of Center
   mean, median, mode

** Measures of Spread
*** Five Number Summary
   - Maximum
   - Third Quartile
   - Second Quartile(Median)
   - First Quartile
   - Minimum

*** Statistics
   - Range: maximum - minimum
   - Interquartile Range(IQR): $Q_3-Q_1$
   - Standard Deviation
   - Variance

** Shape of the Distribution

*** Skewed Distribution Examples
    - Left Skewed
      - GPA
      - Age of Death
      - Price
    - Right Skewed
      - the amount of drug left in your bloodstream over time
      - Distribution of Wealth
      - Athletic Abilities

*** Others
    - bi-modal

** Outliers
   1. Plot the data.
   2. Make a decision on outliers. (Anomaly Detection Field)
   3. If the data is bell shaped, the mean and standard deviation can summarize the data well.
   4. If the data is skewed, five number summary is the better one to describe data.

*** Common Techniques
    - At least note they exist and the impact on summary statistics.
    - If typo - remove or fix
    - Understand why they exist, and the impact on *questions* we are trying to answer about our data.
    - Reporting the 5 number summary values is often a better indication than measures like the mean and standard deviation when we have outliers.
    - Be careful in reporting. Know how to ask the right questions.

* Terminology
  - Population :: our entire group of interest.
  - Parameter :: numeric summary about a population
  - Sample :: subset of the population
  - Statistic :: numeric summary about a sample
  - Descriptive Statistics :: To describe our collected data.
  - Inferential Statistics :: To estimate the population parameter using the sample statistic.
    - Hypothesis Test
    - Confidence Interval
