* Population
   | $\mu$    | mean(expected value) |
   | $\sigma$ | standard deviation   |


* Sampling Distribution
   - Sampling Distribution :: Distribution of sample means
   | $X_i$                   | Variable in Sample i               |
   | $\bar{X_i}$             | sample mean                        |
   | $n$                     | number of samples                  |
   | $M$                     | mean of sample means               |
   | $SE$(Standard Error)    | standard deviation of sample means |
   - $M=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\bar{X_i}$
   - Ratio of $\sigma$ to $SE$: $\frac{\sigma}{SE}=\sqrt{n}$
   - Margin of Error: $z\cdot\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. it's half the width of the confidence interval.
     - e.g. for 95% CI: Margin of Error $= 1.96SE = \frac{1.96\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
   - *Central Limit Theorem*
     $$SE=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$
   - z score of sample mean: $z=\frac{\bar{X_i} - \mu}{SE}$

** Confidence Interval Bounds
   | z-score(critical value)  |  CI |
   |--------------------------+-----|
   | $\pm 1.96$               | 95% |
   | $\pm 2.33$               | 98% |
   $\bar{X_i}$ should be in $(\mu-1.96SE, \mu+1.96SE)$, then 95% Confidence Interval is:
   $$\bar{X_i}-1.96SE<\mu<\bar{X_i}+1.96SE$$
   - 95% CI with the bigger sample size -> the smaller CI bounds

* Hypothesis Testing
** $\alpha$ Levels
   Levels of Likelihood. $\alpha$ level is a criterion for deciding whether or not something is likely or unlikely.
   - 5% (generally used)
   - 1%
   - 0.1%

** Critical Region
   - For one-tailed test

     [[../resources/MOOC/Statistics/CriticalRegionOneTailed.png]]

   - For two-tailed test

     [[../resources/MOOC/Statistics/CriticalRegionTwoTailed.png]]

** Hypotheses
   - $\mu_I$ is the population parameters after the *intervention*. (干预后的实验)
   - $H_0$ (Null Hypothesis): $\mu\approx\mu_I$ (no significant difference)
     - $\mu_I$ is not in critical region
   - $H_a$ (Alternative Hypothesis), or $H_1$
     - $\mu_I$ is in critical region
     - $$\mu\not\approx\mu_I$$
     - $\mu\lt\mu_I$ $\mu_I$ is in the one-tailed right critical region
     - $\mu\gt\mu_I$ one-tailed left critical region
     - $\mu\neq\mu_I$ two-tailed

*** Example
    - $H_0$: Most dogs have four legs. (Most = more than 50%)
    - $H_a$: Most dogs have less than four legs.(one-tailed Test)
    - Sample: 10 dogs, all have four legs. (fail to reject $H_0$)
    - Sample: 10 dogs, 6 dogs have three legs. (reject $H_0$)

** Statistical Decision Errors
   |                          | Reject $H_0$ | Retain $H_0$  |
   | real world $H_0$ *True*  | Type I Error | Correct       |
   | real world $H_0$ *False* | Correct      | Type II Error |

* Scipy Tools
  #+begin_src python
    from scipy.stats import norm

    # 98% CI to z-score
    norm.ppf(0.01+0.98)
    # => 2.3263478740408408
    norm.ppf(0.01)
    # => -2.3263478740408408

    # z-score to cdf, reverse of ppf
    norm.cdf(2.3263478740408408)
    # => 0.99

    # z-score to sf, sf=1-cdf
    norm.sf(2.3263478740408408)
    # => 0.01 # alpha level for one-tailed test
