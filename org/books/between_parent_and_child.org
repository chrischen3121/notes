* Barriers
  - The lack of professional knowledge about raising a child

* Methods
  - Discovering and empathizing with children's feelings and expressing their emotions in a reasonable way.
  - Actively teaching correct behaviors and heavily constraining bad behaviors.
  - Guiding children to motivate and evaluate themselves positively.
  - Allowing children to have a voice and a choice when limitations are set.
