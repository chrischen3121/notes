* findutils
** ~which~
** ~whereis~
   searches a broader range of system directories and is independent of your shell’s search path
** ~locate~
   consults a precompiled index of the filesystem to locate file

* Help
** man
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     man -k regexp
     man -f command # list all sections
   #+END_SRC

*** ~manpath~
    Use ~manpath~ to see locations of the man files

* Booting
  1. Loading BIOS/UEFI from NVRAM
  1. Probe for hardware
  1. Select boot device(disk, network,...)
  1. Identify EFI system partition
  1. Load boot loader(e.g. GRUB)
  1. Determine which kernel to boot
  1. Load kernel
  1. Instantiate kernel data structures
  1. Start init/systemd as PID 1
  1. Execute startup scripts
  1. Running system

** BIOS vs. UEFI
*** Legacy BIOS(Basic Input/Output System)
    BIOS assumes that the boot device starts with a record called the MBR.
    MBR reads and executes the second-stage boot loader(volume boot record)

*** UFEI(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)
    The UEFI specification includes a modern disk partitioning scheme known as GPT(GUID Partition Table).

** GRUB 2
*** config
    - /etc/default/grub
    - /etc/grub.d/40_custom
    - /boot/grub/grub.cfg

      Use *grub-mkconfig* to generate grub.cfg, *update-grub* stub for *grub-mkconfig* on Ubuntu

** init
*** modes
**** Single-user mode
     in which only a minimal set of filesystems is mounted, no services
     are running, and a root shell is started on the console.
**** Multiuser mode
     in which all customary filesystems are mounted and all configured
     network services have been started, along with a window system and graphical login
     manager for the console
**** Server mode
     similar to multiuser mode, but with no GUI running on the console
*** Implementations
**** "traditional *init*" from AT&T’s System V UNIX
     system modes are known as "run levels"
**** BSD *init*
**** *systemd* for linux
**** *launchd* for macOS
**** *Upstart* for ubuntu
** systemd
*** *unit* file
    #+BEGIN_SRC systemd
      [Unit]

    #+END_SRC
    unit directory: */usr/lib/systemd/system* or */lib/systemd/system*.
    */run/systemd/system* that’s a scratch area for transient units.

*** systemctl

**** States
     | State    | Meaning                                                        |
     |----------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
     | bad      | Smoe kind of problem within *systemd*; usually a bad unit file |
     | disabled | Present, but not configured to start autonomously              |

     | masked   | Banished from the *systemd* world from a logical perspective   |
     | static   | Depended upon by another unit; has no install requirements     |

**** Targets
     Target is a group of Units
     #+CAPTION: Mapping between init run levels and systemd targets
     |    Run level | Target            | Description                            |
     |--------------+-------------------+----------------------------------------|
     |            0 | poweroff.target   | System halt                            |
     |    emergency | emergency.target  | Bare-bones shell for system recovery   |
     | 1, s, single | rescue.target     | Single-user mode                       |
     |            2 | multi-user.target | Multiuser mode(command line)           |
     |            3 | multi-user.target | Multiuser mode with networking         |

     |            5 | graphical.target  | Multiuser mode with networking and GUI |
     |            6 | reboot.target     | System reboot                          |
     To change current operating mode, use *systemctl isolate*, like *telinit* for *init*.
     *systemctl get-default* see the target the system boots into by default. *set-default* to set default.

*** Dependencies
    #+CAPTION: Explict dependencies in the [Unit] section
    | Option    | Meaning                                                                  |
    |-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Wants     | Units that should be coactivated if possible, but are not required       |
    | Requires  | Strict dependencies; failure of any prerequisite terminates this service |
    | Requisite | Like Requires, but must already be active                                |
    | BindsTo   | Similar to Requires, but even more tightly coupled                       |
    | PartOf    | Similar to Requires, but affects only starting and stopping              |
    | Conflicts | Negative dependencies; cannot be coactive with these units               |
    Use systemctl *add-wants* or *add-requires* to specify a dependency.
    Or add option *WantedBy* or *RequiredBy* to [Install] section.

*** Execution order
    Use Before/After clauses from the unit files to sort the work list.

*** a more complex example
    #+BEGIN_SRC systemd
      [Unit]
      Description=The nginx HTTP and reverse proxy server
      After=network.target remote-fs.target nss-lookup.target

      [Service]
      Type=forking
      PIDFile=/run/nginx.pid
      ExecStartPre=/usr/bin/rm -f /run/nginx.pid
      ExecStartPre=/usr/sbin/nginx -t
      ExecStart=/usr/sbin/nginx
      ExecReload=/bin/kill -s HUP $MAINPID
      KillMode=process
      KillSignal=SIGQUIT
      TimeoutStopSec=5
      PrivateTmp=true

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target
    #+END_SRC

*** useful man to write unit file
    - *man systemd.service* to see complete list of options for service
    - *man systemd.unit* to see common options for all types

*** customizations
    Add *conf* file to */etc/systemd/system/xxx.service.d* directory.
    - easy way:
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      systemctl edit xxx.service
      systemctl restart xxx.service
    #+END_SRC

*** logging
    System messages captured by *journald* are stored in the */run* directory.

    *rsyslog* can process these messages and store then in traditional log files or
    forward them to a remote syslog server.

    *journalctl* displays log entries. *-u* to specify which service to display.

*** Utilities
    - systemctl
    - systemd-analyze
    - hostnamectl
    - localectl
    - timedatectl
    - loginctl
    - networkctl

** shutdown
*** *halt*
    Performs the essential duties required for shutting down the system
*** *reboot*
    Essentially identical to halt, but it causes the machine to reboot instead of halting
*** *shutdown*
    The shutdown command is a layer over halt and reboot that provides for scheduled shutdowns
    and ominous warnings to logged-in users

* Access Control
** /etc/passwd
*** Login name
*** Encrypted password placeholder
- actual password in */etc/shadow*
- change password restriction by editing */etc/login.defs*
*** UID (user ID) number
*** Default GID (group ID) number
*** GECOS information
    Use *finger* command to interpert GECOS, use *chfn* to change GECOS
    - full name
    - office number and building
    - office telephone extension
    - home phone number

*** Home directory
*** Login shell
    Use *chsh* to change login shell listed in */etc/shells*.

** /etc/shadow
- Login name *required*
- Encrypted password *required*
- Date of last password change
- Minimum number of days between changes
- Maximum number of days between password changes
- Number of days in advance to warn users about password expiration
- Linux: Days after password expiration that account is disabled
- Account expiration date
- A reserved field that is currently always empty

** /etc/group
- Group name
- Encrypted password or a placeholder
- GID number
- List of members, separated by commas


It is possible to enter a group password to allow users not belonging to
a group to enter it with the *newgrp* command.

A password can be set with the *gpasswd* command

A user’s personal group should contain only that user. If you want to let users
share files by way of the group mechanism, create separate groups for that purpose
** /etc/sudoers
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     mark, ed    SOME_HOST_ALIAS=ALL
     herb    SOME_HOST_ALIAS=/usr/sbin/tcpdump : !SOME_HOST_ALIAS=(operator) DUMP
     lynda    ALL=(ALL)ALL, !SOME_CMND_ALIAS
     %wheel    ALL, !SOME_HOST_ALIAS = NOPASSWD: SOME_CMND_ALIAS
   #+END_SRC

   Whitelist the environment variables by adding them to the sudoers file’s env_keep list

** users basic
*** Required
**** Sign policy agreement
**** Edit the *passwd* and *shadow* files to define user
     Use *vipw* to edit *passwd* and *shadow*
**** Add the user to the /etc/group file(optional)
     If the new user should be a member of more groups than just the default group
     specified in the passwd file, you must edit the /etc/group file and add the user’s
     login name to each of the additional groups.
**** Set an initial password
     Use *passwd*
**** Create, *chown*, and *chmod* the user’s home directory.
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
       sudo chown -R newuser:newgroup ~newuser
     #+END_SRC
**** Configure roles and permissions(RBAC)

*** For the user
**** Copy default startup files to the user’s home directory.
**** Set the user’s mail home and establish mail aliases.

*** For administrator
**** Verify that the account is set up correctly.
**** Add the user’s contact information and account status to your database.

*** Verification
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      $ pwd /* verify home directory */
      $ ls -al /* check owner/group of startup files */
    #+END_SRC

** *useradd* command
*** examples
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      sudo useradd -c "chrischen" -d /home/chrischen -m -s /bin/zsh chrischen
      sudo usermod -aG sudo chrishcen
    #+END_SRC
*** ubuntu
    Ubuntu provides two ways to add users: *adduser* and *useradd*. *adduser* is a Perl
    wrapper for useradd that is a bit more helpful (makes home directories, copies in
    startup files, etc.).
    - *adduser* is configured in */etc/adduser.conf*
    - *adduser* has a twin *addgroup* and cousins *deluser* and *delgroup*.

** Disabling logins
   - *usermod -L* to lock user
   - *usermod -U* to unlock user
** Centralizing account management
*** LDAP
*** Identity management systems
** Authentication
*** PAM(Pluggable Authentication Modules)
    PAM is a wrapper for a variety of method-specific authentication libraries.
*** Kerberos: network cryptographic authentication
    PAM is an authentication framework, Kerberos is a specific authentication method,
    PAM and Kerberos generally work together
*** Filesystem ACL
*** Linux capabilities
*** Linux namespaces
** Modern Access Control
*** MAC
*** RBAC
*** Implementations
**** AppArmor
* Process Control
** kernel related data in memory
   - The process’s address space map
   - The current status of the process (sleeping, stopped, runnable, etc.)
   - The execution priority of the process
   - Information about the resources the process has used (CPU, memory, etc.)
   - Information about the files and network ports the process has opened
   - The process’s signal mask (a record of which signals are blocked)
   - The owner of the process

** Signals
   | No | Name  | Description          | Default   | Can catch? | Can block? | Dump core? |
   |----+-------+----------------------+-----------+------------+------------+------------|
   |  1 | HUP   | Hangup               | Terminate | Y          | Y          | N          |

   *kill -l* to list signals.

** *kill*
   - killall: kill by process name
   - pkill: search for process to kill

** *ps*
   Useful options
   - aux: *a* show all processes; *x* show processes that don't have a control terminal; *u* user oriented output format
   - lax: faster than aux(UID only), aslo includes PPID, NI(niceness) and wait channel
     - ww: enable unlimited column width

*** with *grep*
    ps -aux | grep -v grep | grep xxxx
*** alternative command
    - *pidof* :: determine the PID of a process
    - *pgrep*

** *top*
   1: show loads of individual cores
   - H: show threads

*** alternative *htop*

** *nice*
   - Niceness range: ~-20~ to ~19~
   - Only root can run a command with high priority
   - *renice*

** =/proc=
   *ps* and *top* read their process status information from the =/proc= directory
*** useful process files
    cgroups, cmd, cmdline, cwd, environ, exe, fdinfo, ns, root, stat, statm
    - fd :: reperents open files
    - maps :: libraries dependencies

** *strace*(lower level)
   Display every system call that a process makes and every signal it receives
   - ~-f~ to trace sub processes

** load average
   - *uptime*: load average of 1-, 5-, 15-minute intervals(cpu&io)

** identify processes using files or sockets
   - *fuser*
   - *lsof*: list open files

** periodic processes
   - crontab
   - systemd timer

* Filesystem
** mount
   1. ~mkfs.type~
   1. ~mount -t type /dev/sda [mountpoint]~
   - ~umount [mountpoint]~

** mounting
   - =/etc/fstab= :: lists filesystems that are normally mounted on the system.
   - *fuser -c mountpoint* :: prints the PID of every process that’s using a file or directory on that filesystem. uses *-v* to display command name
   - *lsof* ::  alternative to *fusr*, *-F* for easy parsing

** File type
   - investigating file type: ~file~ or ~ls~
     | Symbol | Type                  | Created by |
     |--------+-----------------------+------------|
     | -      | regular file          | editors    |
     | d      | directory             | ~mkdir~    |
     | c      | character device file | ~mknod~    |
     | b      | block device file     | ~mknod~    |

      for ((i=0; i < count; i++)); do
          ...
      done
    #+END_SRC
*** $(())
    The $((...)) notation forces numeric evaluation,
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    $((counter++))
    $(($a+$b))
    #+END_SRC
*** Array
    Use *${array_name[subscript]}* to access individual elements.
    The subscripts * and @ refer to the array as a whole, and the special
    forms *${#array_name[*]}* and *${#array_name[@]}* yield the number of elements in the array.
